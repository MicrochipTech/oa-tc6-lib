 *  \param ip - The 4 Byte ipV4 address.
 *  \enablePlca - true, if PLCA shall be enabled. false, PLCA is off, then nodeId, NodeCount, burstCount and burstTimer are getting ignored.
 *  \nodeId - When PLCA is enabled, this variable sets the PLCA Node Id.
 *  \nodeCount - When PLCA is enabled, this variable sets the PLCA Max Node Id.
 *  \burstCount - When PLCA is enabled, this variable sets the PLCA Burst Counter.
 *  \burstTimer - When PLCA is enabled, this variable sets the PLCA Burst Timer.
 *  \promiscuous - true, when RX MAC filter shall be turned off, then all messages are getting received (sniffing). false, filter is active, only messages with matching MACs (and broadcast/multicast) are getting received.
 *  \txCutThrough - true, when TX cut through shall be active, this helps improving speed further. Note that in that case the MCU/MPU must be able to send at full network speed. false, activates TX store and forward mode.
 *  \rxCutThrough - true, when RX cut through shall be active, this helps improving speed further. Note that in that case the MCU/MPU must be able to receive at full network speed. false, activates RX store and forward mode.
 *  \return The instance number of the current TC6LwIP driver. Starting at 0 and incrementing by one for any further call. Returns -1 when a instance can not be initialized, increase TC6_MAX_INSTANCES.
